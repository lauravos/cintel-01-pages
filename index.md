# Laura's Website

My first website using Markdown and GitHub Pages. 

## Links

Here's a clickable link: [My Github Profile][(https://github.com/lauravos)]

## Images

Images look like links except with an exclamation directly in front

## Reminders

Use a dash space for unordered lists

- Spaces matter

- Spelling matters

- Capitalization matters
